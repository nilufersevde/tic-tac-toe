# Tic Tac Toe 

Vanilla JS Tic Tac Toe project that I created as a part of The Odin Project curriculum.

# Things I learn 

I learn more in depth about scopes with this project. I used a module pattern and factory function for the first time. I spend a great amount of time just to optimise my code on this project, spend some time before getting into any logic of the game for planning ahead and it made my code cleaner. I am learning more on not duplicating my code, wrapping things inside a function and using it whenever I need it.
